# Meta-Diagrams
Implementation of meta-diagram computation for 2-parameter persistence, from the paper "Meta-Diagrams for 2-Parameter Persistence" by Clause, Dey, MÃ©moli and Wang, https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2023/17875/ . This code is a work-in-progress with many changes, operations, and feature improvements planned for the near future. The current code accepts in a point cloud via a text or csv file, defined at the start of main. The user can define any function immediately following this (the current built-in is simply the height function for a point cloud in 2D). The code then computes the meta-rank and meta-diagram for the function-Rips bifiltration associated to the input function and metric space. As noted, there are ongoing changes and improvements, but any feedback/comments/suggestions/requests are welcome, feel free to contact Nate at clause.15@osu.edu .
